### Primitives 
There are four types of peering relationship in FogROS SGC. 
1. Source: Unidirectionally publish the message (ROS subscriber)
2. Sink: Unidirectionally subscribe the message (ROS publisher)
3. Peer: Peering with each other; may forward packet or expect to receive packets (DTLS connection); may get RIB queries 
4. RIB: no data is sent to the RIB, only `GDPAction::RibGet` and `GDPAction::RibReply` are sent/received 

### Design Considerations 
1. separate routing information management with data routing (e.g. announcing a ROS topic does not directly subscribe to the topic, the topic is subscribed only if there is an active subscriber in the network)
2. Use queries instead of flushing. 
3. Smooth Node shutdown 

### Workflow
```
On a new ROS topic (publisher):
    (ROS Topic Manager): advertise the name, register its status handle with RIB
    If status handle receives subscribe request:
        create a thread that subscribes to the topic
        (Note: we don't need to remove the old record because Source does not generate additional routing information)

On a new ROS topic (subscriber):
    (ROS Topic Manager): advertise the name, register its status handle with RIB
    If status handle receives publish advertisement:
        create a thread that publishes to the topic
        manager removes itself from subscribing request
        advertises the new thread that with subscribing request


RIB: 
On a new packet: 
    match GDPAction with 
        Forward: 
            Check its connection_rib hash table 
            If name not found, send query to its own RIB and peers
            (TODO: send Nack that RIB cannot find the name)
            If name is found and sink/peer is not empty, 
                forward the packet 
        Advertisement: 
            Store information to its corresponding connection RIB
            Match NameType with 
                Source: add source to source rib
                    if sink_rib has the name record
                        inform ros topic manager
                Sink: add sink to sink_rib
                    if source_rib has the name record
                        inform ros topic manager
                Peer: add peer to rib
                RIB: (a new RIB!) register the routing information with the RIB

```

### Q&A 
1. How does publish and subscribe eventually peered? Who will initiate this peering?

We are able to trace something like: [topic 256 bit name] is from [ROS local subscriber 256 bit name] which will be delivered from [DTLS peer 256 bit name].
